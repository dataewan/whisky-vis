==========

Pointed to this [dataset about whisky](https://www.mathstat.strath.ac.uk/outreach/nessie/nessie_whisky.html), via a [nice analysis](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/12/k-means-clustering-86-single-malt-scotch-whiskies.html) in R.

I've been looking for a whisky dataset for a while, so very excited to find this.
